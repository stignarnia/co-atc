# Co-ATC: Aircraft Monitoring System

Co-ATC is an AI-enhanced system designed to monitor airspace activity, supporting (imaginary) ATC operations. It integrates real-time ADSB data (local or remote), streams ATC communications (local VHF radio or LiveATC) while leveraging AI to transcribe and interpret communications, track ATC instructions, and generate alerts for potential conflicts or non-compliance.

## What Co-ATC Does

Co-ATC provides air traffic controllers and aviation enthusiasts with:

- **Real-time Aircraft Tracking**: Live visualization of aircraft positions, flight paths, and telemetry data
- **Interactive Map Interface**: Comprehensive airspace view with aircraft details, weather overlays, and runway information
- **Use Local Data Sources**: Connects to your ADSB and [VHF band](https://github.com/rtl-airband/RTLSDR-Airband/pull/523) SDRs for mostly local (offline) tracking
- **AI-Powered Voice Assistant**: Voice-based ATC assistant with comprehensive airspace knowledge and real-time context (OpenAI or Gemini API key required)
- **Audio Transcription**: Real-time transcription and analysis of ATC communications using AI (OpenAI or Gemini API key required)
- **Flight Phase Detection**: Automatic detection and tracking of aircraft flight phases (taxi, takeoff, departure, cruise, arrival, approach, touchdown)
- **ATC Clearance Extraction**: AI-powered extraction and tracking of takeoff, landing, and approach clearances (OpenAI or Gemini API key required)
- **Aircraft Simulation**: Create and control simulated aircraft for training and testing scenarios
- **Weather Integration**: Live METAR, TAF, and NOTAM data integration (using "stolen" Windy APIs - sorry!)
- **Alert System**: Real-time notifications for aircraft status changes and potential issues (incomplete)

## Current State

Co-ATC is in semi-active development with core functionality implemented and operational. The system successfully processes real-time ADS-B data, provides interactive map visualization, transcribes ATC communications, and offers AI-powered assistance (airport advisory services). 

For detailed progress and implementation specifics, see [Project Specification and Progress](docs/project_progress.md).

## Installation and Setup

### Option 1: Download Pre-compiled Binaries

The quickest way to get Co-ATC running is to download pre-compiled binaries from the releases page.

1. **Download the latest release** from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/yegors/co-atc/releases)
2. **Clone the repository** (required for assets and www folders):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yegors/co-atc.git
   cd co-atc
   ```
3. **Extract the binary** to the project root directory
4. **Proceed to Configuration** section below

#### Windows
```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yegors/co-atc.git
cd co-atc

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Build the application using the build script
.\build.ps1
```
